    <h3><u>Bio</u></h3><br>
    <p>Dr. Christoforos Christoforou is an Assistant Professor in the Division of Computer Science, Mathematics and Science at St. John’s University. He completed his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and his Master’s degree from the the City College of the City University of New York. His research focuses on machine learning methods and their applications to neuro-cinematics, brain-computer interfacing and computational neuroscience. His research work was published in top-tier journals including the “Journal of Machine Learning Research” (IF:2.8), “IEEE Signal Processing Magazine” (IF:6.67), “Proceedings of the IEEE” (IF:5.63) and the “Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience” (IF:2.65). Moreover, his research was featured in a number of popular media articles and documentaries including, the “IEEE Spectrum”, and the History Channel Documentary “The Brain”. Dr. Christoforou was a Research Scientist at the Center for Applied Neuroscience of the University of Cyprus for 5 years. In addition, he has taught for the City College of the City University of New York and the Cyprus University of Technology, and delivered lectures for the University of Cyprus and the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics. Previously, Dr. Christoforou held a number of industry positions. He is also the founder of two technology start-ups that are based on his research on machine learning, computational-neuroscience and neuro-cinematics. Dr. Christoforou has also been successful in securing a number of grants to fund his research, three of which as Principal Investigator (PI/co-PI). He put together research consortia with partners from around Europe, and drafted multiple grant applications under distinct European Funding Programmes, such as the 7th Framework Programme (FP7), EUROSTARS, ERC-Starting/ERC-Synergy, European Structural Funds, and the Cyprus Research Promotion Foundation. He maintains an ongoing research program and is actively pursuing new collaborations and grant opportunities.</p>
